## Mongoose CRUD Operations

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates CRUD operations using Mongoose with MongoDB. The program connects to a local MongoDB database and performs various operations on a "Fruit" collection.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage

1. Open the `index.js` file in a text editor.
2. Uncomment the desired operation(s) you want to perform (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
3. Customize the operation parameters if needed.
4. Save the file.
5. Run the program: `node index.js`

### Available Operations

- Create: Adds a single fruit document or inserts multiple fruits at once.
- Read: Retrieves all fruits from the database.
